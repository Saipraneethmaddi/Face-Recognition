
Steps to run the code:
1) Before running the python file, please make sure that libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit Learn, matplotlib.pyplot, OS are installed.
2) Open the python file "program.py".
3) Run the code.
4) It gives accuracy, projected and reprojected images, top ten eigen faces, least ten eigen faces as output.
   Then it asks for an input file path, provide the image path for which it has to predict the face.
5) Finally, it gives the labelled name of face in the image.

Precautions:
1) Ensure that "program.py" and "CroppedYale" folder are in same folder.
2) Please make sure that input image(path) to the code is an image in a subfolder of "CroppedYale" folder.
   Because there are other type of files in the subfolders of "CroppedYale" folder. Image file has extension ".pgm".
